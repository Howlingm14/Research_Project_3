This repository contains the key code used in my investigation into the use of RL to solve complex path finding problems with obstacles and variable rewards. The python files contain the environments used inlcuding past iterations. Environmenttt.py is the original main environment. The Jupyter notebooks contain the agents used to investigate various aspects of the problem. They also contain all the code used for the data analysis in this investigation.
